## Task 1

- did not add products for Services Support, Small Business Product Support as there are none.
- Software (Cisco ONE) - the HTML has very little structure in order to parse this. I can get the content, but headings and products seem to get mixed.

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge pygraphviz
```

- 0-9 products not parsed since I initially thought they were not products for some reason.
Add 'prodByNumber'
'numeric'
'something else'

<add functionality for 0-9 products too>

## Task 2
